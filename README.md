# LifeHelper

LifeHelper is a multi-feature Android app project that includes basic systems for dating, restaurant listings, user accounts, and wallet management. The backend was written in raw PHP, without any framework.

The idea was to create an all-in-one platform, combining social media, dating, and delivery services (similar to what Elon Musk describes [here](https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-elon-musks-x-the-everything-app/)).

## Project Highlights

- Developed multiple systems including:
  - User authentication and profile management
  - Dating features
  - Restaurant listings
  - Wallet and transaction management
- Backend built from scratch in PHP
- All code stored in the same repository for convenience
- PHP backend code: [View on GitHub](https://github.com/b-Istiak-s/LifeHelper/tree/main/app/src/main/java/com/lifehelper/PHP/life_helper)

## Background

When I started working on this project, I had no idea what "backend" even meant. I picked things up quickly and adapted while working at Khelboo. At the time, I didn't have a GitHub workflow; I stored code in ZIP files on Google Drive. I only uploaded the code to GitHub much later and ran into errors during the push, which I didn’t have time to fix due to schoolwork and other commitments. Eventually, I had to stop working on it.

I was also brainstorming a startup idea with the former CEO of [Khelboo](https://www.linkedin.com/company/khelboo-com/), some time after I stopped working on the project, due to school work and other commitments. 

## Tech Stack

- PHP (no framework)
- Java (Android)
- MySQL

## Notes

- I don’t have screenshots or a working version of the app anymore.
- I have no intention of perfecting or continuing development on this.
- Despite being unfinished and possibly un-runnable today, this project reflects my early growth and initiative as a self-taught developer.
